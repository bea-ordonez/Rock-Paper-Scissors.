### Context:
I am currently a student in the Turing Front End Program and this is my final solo project for Mod 1. I spent approximately 25-30 hours completing this project.

### Learning Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of DRY JS and event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust myself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Tech Used:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS



### Wins:
- I was able to think through the logic and complete most of the functionality before I needed to reach out for help.
- I am pretty happy with the CSS throughout the project.

### Challenges:
- I think the hardest part was getting started, it was overwhelming at first to look at the entire project. Breaking it into smaller portions and completing each task made it easier to focus and gave me a feeling of accomplisment throughout.
